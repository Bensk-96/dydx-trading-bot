Statistical arbitrage works by identifying patterns in historical price data to predict future price movements and exploit short-term imbalances between the prices of assets.

Improvement Ideas
- replace market order by limit order
- Fix Telegram messaging bug (AWS)
- Revise and simplify trading logic
- Test different trading frequency(e.g. 1 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins)
- Implementation with websocket and asynchronous structure
- Implmentation on Testnet of other exchanges(e.g. Binance Future), because DYDX Testnet is sometime not liquid
